```

BrowserOnly can help you manage your social media presence:

```
Go to Twitter, check my notifications, and summarize any mentions or replies I've received in the past 24 hours.
```

```

### Email Management

BrowserOnly can help you manage your email:

```
Go to Gmail, find all unread emails from the last week, and create a summary of each one.
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Be Specific

The more specific your instructions, the better BrowserOnly can help you:

- Instead of: "Find flights"
- Try: "Go to Kayak and find flights from New York to London for next weekend, prioritizing morning departures"

### Use Step-by-Step Instructions

For complex tasks, break them down into steps:

```
First, go to my Google Drive. Then, find the folder named "Work Projects". Next, create a new Google Doc titled "Project Plan". Finally, type "# Project Plan" as a heading.
```

### Leverage Memory

BrowserOnly remembers previous interactions with websites, making repeat tasks more efficient:

```
Go to my company's HR portal and submit my timesheet for this week, just like I did last week.
```

## Troubleshooting

### BrowserOnly Can't Access a Website

- Make sure you're logged in to the website if it requires authentication
- Check if the website has anti-bot measures that might be blocking BrowserOnly
- Try refreshing the page and trying again

### Commands Not Working as Expected

- Be more specific in your instructions
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Check if the website's layout has changed since your last visit

### High Token Usage

- Use more concise instructions
- For repetitive tasks, create memories to reduce token usage
- Consider switching to a more cost-effective LLM provider

## Privacy and Security

BrowserOnly is designed with privacy in mind:

- Your data stays in your browser (except for what's sent to the LLM provider)
- API keys are stored locally in your browser
- BrowserOnly can't access your browser history or other sensitive information unless you explicitly instruct it to

However, be aware that:

- Text sent to LLM providers is subject to their privacy policies
- Be cautious when asking BrowserOnly to interact with sensitive websites like banking portals
